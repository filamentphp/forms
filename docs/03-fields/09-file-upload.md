import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The file upload field is based on [Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/file-upload/simple" alt="File upload" version="3.x" />

> Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-medialibrary`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary). See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/spatie-media-library) for more information.

## Configuring the storage disk and directory

By default, files will be uploaded publicly to your storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../installation#publishing-configuration). You can also set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

> Please note, to correctly preview images and other files, FilePond requires files to be served from the same domain as the app, or the appropriate CORS headers need to be present. Ensure that the `APP_URL` environment variable is correct, or modify the [filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/filesystem) driver to set the correct URL. If you're hosting files on a separate domain like S3, ensure that CORS headers are set up.

To change the disk and directory for a specific field, and the visibility of files, use the `disk()`, `directory()` and `visibility()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->disk('s3')
    ->directory('form-attachments')
    ->visibility('private')
```

> Please note, it is the responsibility of the developer to delete these files from the disk if they are removed, as Filament is unaware if they are depended on elsewhere. One way to do this automatically is observing a [model event](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#events).

## Uploading multiple files

You may also upload multiple files. This stores URLs in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
```

If you're saving the file URLs using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Message extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'attachments' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Controlling file names

By default, a random file name will be generated for newly-uploaded files. This is to ensure that there are never any conflicts with existing files.

### Preserving original file names

To preserve the original filenames of the uploaded files, use the `preserveFilenames()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->preserveFilenames()
```

### Generating custom file names

You may completely customize how file names are generated using the `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` method, and returning a string from the closure based on the `$file` that was uploaded:

```php
use Livewire\TemporaryUploadedFile;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing(
        fn (TemporaryUploadedFile $file): string => (string) str($file->getClientOriginalName())
            ->prepend('custom-prefix-'),
    )
```

### Storing original file names independently

You can keep the randomly generated file names, while still storing the original file name, using the `storeFileNamesIn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->storeFileNamesIn('attachment_file_names')
```

`attachment_file_names` will now store the original file name/s of your uploaded files, so you can save them to the database when the form is submitted. If you're uploading `multiple()` files, make sure that you add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to this Eloquent model property too.

## Cropping and resizing images

Filepond allows you to crop and resize images before they are uploaded. You can customize this behaviour using the `imageCropAspectRatio()`, `imageResizeTargetHeight()` and `imageResizeTargetWidth()` methods. `imageResizeMode()` should be set for these methods to have an effect - either [`force`, `cover`, or `contain`](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/image-resize).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageResizeMode('cover')
    ->imageCropAspectRatio('16:9')
    ->imageResizeTargetWidth('1920')
    ->imageResizeTargetHeight('1080')
```

## Altering the appearance of the file upload area

You may also alter the general appearance of the Filepond component. Available options for these methods are available on the [Filepond website](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#styles).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->imagePreviewHeight('250')
    ->loadingIndicatorPosition('left')
    ->panelAspectRatio('2:1')
    ->panelLayout('integrated')
    ->removeUploadedFileButtonPosition('right')
    ->uploadButtonPosition('left')
    ->uploadProgressIndicatorPosition('left')
```

## Reordering files

You can also allow users to re-order uploaded files using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
```

When using this method, FilePond may add newly-uploaded files to the beginning of the list, instead of the end. To fix this, use the `appendFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
    ->appendFiles()
```

## Opening files in a new tab

You can add a button to open each file in a new tab with the `openable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->openable()
```

## Downloading files

If you wish to add a download button to each file instead, you can use the `downloadable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->downloadable()
```

## Previewing files

By default, some file types can be previewed in FilePond. If you wish to disable the preview for all files, you can use the `previewable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->previewable(false)
```

## Moving files instead of copying when the form is submitted

By default, files are initially uploaded to Livewire's temporary storage directory, and then copied to the destination directory when the form is submitted. If you wish to move the files instead, providing that temporary uploads are stored on the same disk as permanent files, you can use the `moveFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->moveFiles()
```

## Preventing files from being stored permanently

If you wish to prevent files from being stored permanently when the form is submitted, you can use the `storeFiles(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->storeFiles(false)
```

When the form is submitted a temporary file upload object will be returned instead of a permanently stored file path. This is perfect for temporary files like imported CSVs.

## Orienting images from their EXIF data

By default, FilePond will automatically orient images based on their EXIF data. If you wish to disable this behaviour, you can use the `orientImagesFromExif(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->orientImagesFromExif(false)
```

## File upload validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to file uploads.

Since Filament is powered by Livewire and uses its file upload system, you will want to refer to the default [Livewire file upload validation rules](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/file-uploads#global-validation) as well. This also controls the 12MB file size maximum.

### File type validation

You may restrict the types of files that may be uploaded using the `acceptedFileTypes()` method, and passing an array of MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('document')
    ->acceptedFileTypes(['application/pdf'])
```

You may also use the `image()` method as shorthand to allow all image MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
```

### File size validation

You may also restrict the size of uploaded files, in kilobytes:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->minSize(512)
    ->maxSize(1024)
```

### Number of files validation

You may customize the number of files that may be uploaded, using the `minFiles()` and `maxFiles()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->minFiles(2)
    ->maxFiles(5)
```
